# Notes
## Creating A GitHub Repository
This was a very interesting assignment for me. I've used GitHub repositories before but I've never made a repository on my own. I've also never had to resolve merge issues and that was really interesting to me 

##Intro to HTML
This was a super useful unit! It was nic eot get some basic insight into what styling with HTML is like. It was also nice to interact with the codePen examples. It helped me better understand the overall HTML format and the nesting of the code has begun to make sense for me.

##Intro to CSS
I thought it was really neat to learn more about CSS. In fact, now that I understand how styling elements work, I've realized that I probably need to go in and adjust some of my HTML code in my startup to better reflect my design needs. I was honestly picking a lot of the types (i.e. <h1> vs <h2>) on nothing more than vibes, which is not good. But it's cool how learning more about CSS helped me understand html more. 

##CSS Deliverable
I was suprised to see how much more sense html made once I started working with CSS. I feel like using the two of them together gave me a better understanding of both languages. Overall, I enjoy styling with html and think that the bootstrap elements make everythihng really aesthetic for the user and easy for the developer. 

### Adjusting to my new computer
I got a new computer a bit ago and it has been HARD to set everything up correctly. With creating a new repository, transferring my pem files, and getting all of the new simon stuff set up (in addition to all of the programs I had to reinstall)
